Release history for xpointerbarrier

next
  [Fixed]
  - Setting insets of "0" no longer creates conflicting barriers, which
    would result in one-directional barriers. (Fix for GitHub issue #1.)

v17.10  2017-10-18
  [Fixed]
  - We now use XRRGetMonitors(). In contrast to XRRGetScreenResources(),
    it does not cause the X server to hang for a few hundred
    milliseconds.

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v16.08  2016-08-20
  [Fixed]
  - Improve signal handling, don't call fprintf.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  - Initial release.
  - Daemon, XRandR, signals, manpages.
